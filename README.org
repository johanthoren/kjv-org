#+TITLE: kjv-org

* Introduction

A collection of files containing the Authorized King James version of the Bible
in org format. Use these together with Emacs org-mode.

Some formatting has been carried over. Namely /italics/ for words added by the
translators. As far as possible, the paragraph breaks have also been preserved
and are simply an extra line break in the text.

None of the files have yet been proof read. Contributions are welcome for any
errors that may have snuck in during the conversion process.
