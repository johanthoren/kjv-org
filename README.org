#+TITLE: kjv-org

* Introduction

A collection of files containing the Authorized King James version of the Bible
in org format. Use these together with Emacs org-mode.

Some formatting has been carried over. Namely /italics/ for words added by the
translators. As far as possible, the paragraph breaks have also been preserved
and are simply an extra line break in the text.

None of the files have yet been proof read. Contributions are welcome for any
errors that may have snuck in during the conversion process.

* Generate a single file
For performance purposes, and to easier track changes in git, the files are
split into individual books. If you would rather have one big file containing
the whole Bible, follow the steps below:

1. Make sure that you are in the directory containing all the individual books
   as well as this README.md file.

2. Execute the script.
~$ sh generate_single_file.sh~

3. At the end, the following line should be shown:
~All done.~

4. Now you have a brand new file named "KJV.org" containing all the individual
   books.

*IMPORTANT:* The script includes an option to overwrite an existing file. Make
sure to move your file to another location if you plan on making notes, or
adding changes to the file, so that you don't overwrite it in the future.
